            <p>“He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much; Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children; Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task; Who has
                never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it; Who has left the world better than he found it, Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul; Who has always looked for the best in others and given them
                the best he had; Whose life was an inspiration; Whose memory a benediction.”</p>
            <p>“The truth is, unless you let go, unless you forgive yourself, unless you forgive the situation, unless you realize that the situation is over, you cannot move forward.Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. If you
                aren’t grateful for what you already have, what makes you think you would be happy with more.”</p>
