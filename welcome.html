            to. No obstacle is too big or too difficult for me to handle because what lies inside me is greater than what lies ahead of me. I am committed to improving myself and I am getting better daily. I am not held back by regret or mistakes from
            the past. I am moving forward daily. Absolutely nothing is impossible for me.”
